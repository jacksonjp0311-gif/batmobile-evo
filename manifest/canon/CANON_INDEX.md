# BATMOBILE.EVO — CANON INDEX (A2.0.V1.2)

This repo contains an **architecture bridge surface** and **benchmark/hypothesis contracts**.
It does **not** claim performance, scaling, or correctness.

## Surfaces
- manifest/architecture/ — architecture + interface descriptions
- manifest/theory/ — theory notes (if present via overlay)
- manifest/directory_lock/ — directory skeleton lock + invariants
- docs/hypothesis/ — falsification + benchmark contracts
- enchmarks/ — harness outputs (schema only until runners exist)

## Non-Claims
- No perf claims
- No scaling claims
- Scaffold only (repo-coherent evolution surface)
