# BATMOBILE.EVO — Falsification Outcome (A2.0.V1.5)

## Status
EMPIRICAL EXECUTION SURFACE ACTIVATED.

## Completed
- Kernel callable
- Benchmark runner emits artifact JSON
- Environment fingerprint embedded

## Not Yet Completed
- CUDA specialization
- ℓ-unrolled kernels
- Nsight profiling
- True equivariance enforcement

## Next Fail Conditions
- If specialization does not outperform generic path → FAILED_ADVANTAGE
- If equivariance breaks under rotation → FAILED_EQUIV
