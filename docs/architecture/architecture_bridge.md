# BATMOBILE.EVO — Architecture Bridge (A2.0.V1.2)

## What this is
A repository scaffold that separates:
- **Architecture/Theory surfaces** (manifest + docs)
from
- **Executable kernels** (src/python) and future benchmark harness.

## Directory Map
- \manifest/architecture\ — architecture notes + interfaces
- \manifest/theory\ — theory notes (overlay-provided)
- \docs/hypothesis\ — benchmark + falsification contracts
- \enchmarks\ — result artifacts (schema + future runners)
- \scripts\ — entrypoints (build/test/bench)

## Non-Claims
No performance claims. No scaling claims. Scaffold only.
